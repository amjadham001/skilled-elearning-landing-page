## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Tailwind doesn't process the CSS custom property value
The spaces in the custom property aren't handled by Tailwind's underscore conversion

### Useful resources

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - This tool helped me to view and inspect the design in more detail such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`, to get a perfect and consistent result.
